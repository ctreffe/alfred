## A note on the version number

Alfred3 is currently at version 1.x.x, because it is already in use for research. However, it does currently lack comprehensive documentation and automatic unit testing. Also, some of its most powerful extensions are not currently publicly available. Currently, we lack the resources to upgrade our documentation and testing capacities, focusing mainly on maintaining the current state of the library.
