Alfred3 is a package for Python 3 offering experimenters in the social 
sciences a fast and easy way to create truly dynamic computer experiments 
for a wide range of applications.

## Installation

If you have Python 3.7 or newer installed, just install alfred3 via pip

```
$ pip3 install alfred3
```

## Documentation

Documentation and tutorials for alfred3's most important features
is available here: [Link to docs](https://jobrachem.github.io/alfred_docs/html/index.html)

## A "Hello, world" experiment

Creating a hello-world experiment is as easy as writing this *script.py*
file. You can even do it in a simple text editor. Note that the file
must be named ``script.py``

```python
import alfred3 as al
exp = al.Experiment()
exp += al.Page("Hello, world!", name="hello_world") 
```

To run the script, open a terminal and change the working directory to
your experiment directory:

```
$ cd path/to/experiment
```

Next, simply execute the following command in the terminal::

```
$ alfred3 run
```

If you have *Google Chrome* installed on your machine, a browser window 
with the experiment opens automatically. Otherwise, open any webbrowser 
and visit ``http://127.0.0.1:5000/start`` to start the experiment.

Of course, this "Hello, world" experiment does not contain much content:
Only a single page with a heading. To learn how to add content to an 
experiment, visit our tutorials: (to be filled)
