Your first experiment
=====================

.. note::
    This is currently only included as a placeholder.


This guide leads you step by step through the creation of a simple
experiment. It will have the following features:

- Random assignment of an experiment condition
- A welcome page and informed consent
- Instructions read in from external files
- A number of pages generated with a loop, using external files
- A questionnaire with demographic data at the end of the experiment
- A page for entering administrative data, needed for processing a
  reward for the experiment. The administrative data will be unlinked,
  which means that it is saved separately from the experiment data and
  does not contain information that allows linking to experiment data.
