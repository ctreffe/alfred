class ListRandomizer:
    """
    Offers efficient list randomization.

    Args:
        *conditions: A variable number of tuples, defining the experiment
            conditions. The tuples have the form ``("str", int)``, where
            *str* is a string giving the condition's name, and *int* is
            the target number of observations for this condition.
        
        exp (alfred3.ExperimentSession): The alfred3 experiment session.
        
        id (str): A unique identifier for the condition slot assigned
            by this instance of *ListRandomizer*. If *None*, the current
            :attr:`.ExperimentSession.session_id` will be used. 
            This argument enables you to assign, for example, a group
            id that connects several sessions, to the randomizer.
            Defaults to None.
        
        respect_version (bool): If True, randomization will start anew
            for each experiment version. This is especially important,
            if you make changes to the condition setup of an ongoing
            experiment. This might cause the randomizer to fail, causing
            :class:`.ConditionInconsistency` errors.
            Setting *respect_version* to True can fix such issues. 
            Defaults to True.
        
        mode (str): Can be one of 'strict' or 'inclusive'. 
        
            If 'strict', the randomizer will only assign a condition 
            slot, if there are no active sessions for that slot. It will
            not assign a condition slot, if a session in that slot
            is finished, or if there is an ongoing session in that slot
            that has not yet timed out. You will end up with exactly
            as many participants in each condition, as specified in the
            target size. 
            
            If 'inclusive', the randomizer will assign a condition slot,
            if there is no finished session in that slot. That means,
            there might be two ongoing sessions for the same slot, and
            both might end up to finish.

            While 'strict' mode might lead to participants being turned
            away before the experiment is really complete, 'inclusive'
            mode might lead to more data being collected than necessary.

            Defaults to 'strict'.
        
        random_seed: The random seed used for reproducible pseudo-random
            behavior. This seed will be used for shuffling the condition
            list. Defaults to the current system time. Valid seeds are
            all values that are accepted by :func:`random.seed`
        
        abort_page (alfred3.page.Page): You can reference a custom
                page to be displayed to new participants, if the 
                experiment is full.

    The ListRandomizer is used by initializing it (either directly
    or via the convenience method :meth:`.balanced`) and using the
    method :meth:`.get_condition` to receive a condition. By default,
    the ListRandomizer will automatically abort new sessions and display
    an information page for participants, if the experiment is full. This
    behavior can be customized (see :meth:`.get_condition`).

    .. warning:: Be mindful of the argument *respect_version*! With the
        default setting (True), randomization starts from scratch for
        every experiment version. If you set it to False, you will
        run into an error, if you change anything about the conditions.
    
    Notes: 

        **List Randomization**

        In naive randomization, you might end up with a very unbalanced
        design. For example, if you recruit 300 participants and randomize
        them into two conditions, you might end up with 100 participants in
        the first and 200 in the second condition. If you aim for a balanced
        design with 150 participants in either condition, you might have 
        to recruit more than 300 participants and throw away lots of observations
        in the condition that turned out to be larger. 

        List randomization solves this problem, which is why it is commonly
        used in offline studies. Let's take an easy example. We might have
        two conditions, a and b, each of which should be completed by three participants.
        The order in which participants are assigned to a condition should be
        random. To achieve this, we create a list that contains a condition 
        slot for each participant::

            ["a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b"]

        We then shuffle this list, which might lead to something like the
        following::

            ["b", "a", "a", "b", "a", "b"]
        
        Then, the conditions are assigned to participants based on the
        shuffled list in the order that they start the experiment.

        **Using the ListRandomizer offline**

        You can use the ListRandomizer offline, i.e. without using a
        mongoDB for data saving. In this case, you must keep in mind,
        that the shuffled list will only be shared on one machine. 
        Offline, randomization cannot be synchronized across multiple
        machines.
    
    Examples:

        A minimal experiment with two conditions. If the experiment
        is full, the experiment will immediately abort new sessions
        and display an abort page to new participants::

            import alfred3 as al
            exp = al.Experiment()

            @exp.setup
            def setup(exp):
                randomizer = al.ListRandomizer(("cond1", 10), ("cond2", 10), exp=exp)
                exp.condition = randomizer.get_condition()
            
            @exp.member
            class DemoPage(al.Page):

                def on_exp_access(self):

                    if self.exp.condition == "cond1":
                        lab = "label in condition 1"
                    
                    elif self.exp.condition == "cond2":
                        lab = "label in condition 2"
            
                    self += al.TextEntry(leftlab=lab, name="t1")
        
        You can use the alternative constructor :meth:`.balanced` for
        simplified initialization, if you use the same sample size for 
        all experiment conditions::

            import alfred3 as al
            exp = al.Experiment()

            @exp.setup

            This is an example of customizing the 'full' behavior. 
            It basically re-implements the default behavior, but showcases how
            you can customize behavior by catching the "AllConditionsFull"
            exception::

                import alfred3 as al
                exp = al.Experiment()

                @exp.setup
                def setup(exp):
                    randomizer = al.ListRandomizer(("cond1", 10), ("cond2", 10), exp=exp)
                    try:
                        exp.condition = randomizer.get_condition(raise_exception=True)
                    except al.AllConditionsFull:
                        full_page = al.Page(title="Experiment closed.", name="fullpage")
                        full_page += al.Text("Sorry, the experiment currently does not accept any further participants")
                        exp.abort(reason="full", page=full_page)
                
                
                @exp.member
                class DemoPage(al.Page):

                    def on_exp_access(self):

                        if self.exp.condition == "cond1":
                            lab = "label in condition 1"
                        
                        elif self.exp.condition == "cond2":
                            lab = "label in condition 2"
                
                        self += al.TextEntry(leftlab=lab, name="t1")
            
            The following is an example of a custom page displayed when
            the experiment is full. Note that it, basically implements
            the same behavior as the previous example, it is just a little
            more convenient::

                import alfred3 as al
                exp = al.Experiment()

                @exp.setup
