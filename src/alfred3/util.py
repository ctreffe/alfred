def prefix_keys_safely(data: dict, base: dict, prefix: str ="", sep: str = "_") -> dict:
    """
    Takes the *data* dict and prefixes its keys in a way that makes sure
    that there are no keys that are present in both the resulting prefixed
    dictionary and the *base* dictionary.

    If the planned prefixing of any key in *data* would result in a 
    conflict with a key in *base*, the separator *sep* will be continually
    repeated until there is no conflict anymore.
    
    For example, a single underscore would be turned into a double 
    underscore on first try. Then into a triple underscore, and so on.

    This can be useful, if you want to update the *base* dictionary with
    the *data* dictionary without the danger of losing data.

    Returns:
        dict: A version of the *data* dictionary, in which all keys received
        the prefix in a way that does not cause conflicts with the *base*
        dictionary.
    
    Notes:
        Actually, prefixes of the output dictionary are checked very 
        conservatively, which makes the process more safe and more efficient. The
        function does not check every single key of the output dictionary,
        but it checks if any key in the *base* dictionary has the same
        prefix. If so, this counts as a key collision and the separator
        will be repeated.

    Examples:
        
        In this example, prefixing works without any conflict resolution
        being necessary:

        >>> a = {"k": "val1"}
        >>> b = {"k": "val2"}
        >>> prefixed = prefix_keys_safely(data=b, base=a, prefix="demo")
        >>> prefixed
        {"demo_k": "val2"}

        >>> a.update(prefixed)
        >>> a
        {"k": "val1", "demo_k": "val2"}

        Second example, demonstrating how conflicts are resolved:
        
        >>> a = {"demo_k": "val1"}
        >>> b = {"k": "val2"}
        >>> prefixed = prefix_keys_safely(data=b, base=a, prefix="demo")
        >>> prefixed
        {"demo__k": "val2"}

        >>> a.update(prefixed)
        >>> a
        {"demo_k": "val1", "demo__k": "val2"}

        Third example, demonstrating how convervative the approach is.
        Even though there is no direct collision, the prefix collides
        with the start of a key in ``a``, which causes the function
        to repeat the separator:

        >>> a = {"demo_key1": "val1"}
        >>> b = {"k": "val2"}
        >>> prefixed = prefix_keys_safely(data=b, base=a, prefix="demo")
        >>> prefixed
        {"demo__k": "val2"}

        >>> a.update(prefixed)
        >>> a
        {"demo_key1": "val1", "demo__k": "val2"}
    """
    if not sep:
        raise ValueError("Separator must not be empty.")
    
    while any([str(k).startswith(prefix) for k in base.keys()]):
        prefix += sep
    
    return prefix_keys(d=data, prefix=prefix, sep=sep)
