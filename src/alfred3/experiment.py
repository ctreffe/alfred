"""
This module contains the main experiment and experiment session objects.

**What's the difference between the Experiment and the 
ExperimentSession?**

* The Experiment class is the first thing you create in your *script.py*.
  Its purpose is simply to collect all pages and functions that you
  add to the experiment. For this purpose it offers decorators like
  *setup* and *member*.
  From this collection, it creates a new ExperimentSession for every new
  subject.

* The ExperimentSession class is the main experiment organizer. This is
  the class that actually coordinates all the work in an ongoing 
  experiment. When you interact with a Section's or a Page's *exp*
  attribute, you are actually interacting with the current
  *ExperimentSession* object.

class Experiment:
    """
    Used to construct the experiment in script.py.

    Experiment members can be added with the augmented assigment
    operator ``+=`` (see exampples). They can be accessed with the
    dictionary-style square bracket syntac and with the attribute-style
    dot syntax (see examples).

    The class acts as an organizing container for pages and section for
    orderly instantiation of the :class:`.ExperimentSession`.

    Examples:

        Create an experiment and add simple page in object oriented
        style::

            import alfred3 as al
            exp = al.Experiment()

                def on_exp_access(self):
                    self += al.TextEntry(toplab="Enter something", name="text1")

        Access a page with square bracket syntax.

        >>> exp["page1"]
        Page(class="Page", name="page1")

        Access a page with attribute syntax

        >>> exp.page1

          bar  should stay at a fixed position at the top of the page,
          when subjects scroll down on a long page.

        The progress bar can be customized by redefining it with a

        See Also:
            See :class:`.element.ProgressBar` for more information on
            how to specify a custom progress bar.

        Notes:
            The experiment-wide progress bar *always* receives a name
            of ``progress_bar_``.

        Notes:
            A special url parameter 'jumpto' can be used to trigger a
            jump to a specific page at the start of the session.

        Examples:

               Alfred will look for this variable and use the key

            2. Create a secrets.conf file in your experiment directory

               If you define this option, this key will be preferred

            The key must be a string containing a valid fernet key,
            generated by :meth:`cryptography.fernert.Fernet.generate_key`.

            A string key can be generated with a few lines of python code:
