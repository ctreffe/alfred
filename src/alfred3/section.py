    The basic section, allows forward and backward movements.

    Args:
        shuffle (bool): If True, the order of all members in this
            section will be randomized every time the section is entered.
            Shuffling is not recursive, it only affects direct members
            of a section. That means, if there are subsections,
            their position in the parent section will be randomized,
            but the members within the subsection will not be affected.
            Defaults to False. Can be defined as a class attribute.

        Using a basic section and filling it with a page in instance
