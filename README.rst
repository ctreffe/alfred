alfred3 - a library for rapid experiment development

Alfred3 is a package for Python 3 offering experimenters in the social 
sciences a fast and easy way to create truly dynamic computer experiments 
for a wide range of applications. See 
http://www.the-experimenter.com/framework for more information.

Installation
------------

If you have Python 3.7 or newer installed, just install alfred3 via pip::

    $ pip3 install alfred3

A detailed step-by-step guide is available here:

A "Hello, world" experiment
---------------------------

Creating a hello-world experiment is as easy as writing this *script.py*
file. You can even do it in a simple text editor. Note that the file
must be named ``script.py``::

    # script.py
    import alfred3 as al
    exp = al.Experiment()
    exp += al.Page("Hello, world!", name="hello_world") 

The script can be run by executing the following commands from a terminal 
from within the project directory::

    $ cd <path/to/project/directory>
    $ python3 -m alfred3.run

The first line changes the current working directory to the project
directory (the directory in which your *script.py* is located). The second 
line runs the experiment. If you have the *Google Chrome* browser 
installed on your machine, a browser window with the experiment opens 
automatically. Otherwise, open any webbrowser and visit 
``http://127.0.0.1:5000/start`` to start the experiment.

Of course, this "Hello, world" experiment does not contain much content:
Only a single page with a heading. To learn how to add content to an 
experiment, visit our tutorials:

A note on the version number
----------------------------

Alfred3 is currently at version 1.x.x, because it is already in use for 
research. However, it does currently lack comprehensive documentation 
and automatic unit testing. Also, some of its most powerful extensions 
are not currently publicly available. Currently, we lack the resources 
to upgrade our documentation and testing capacities, focusing mainly on 
maintaining the current state of the library.
